# gitignore-challenge

As an extra credit incentive, in GitHub, there is a setting that allows .gitignore file so that when a git push is made to a public resource and calls an api, it not pushed or visible for anyone else to see

ASK:
Add config.py file to .gitignore and be able to show can do a git push and that that file is not pushed to the repo (2:42 in recording)
